# Fraud Detection System: A Deep Learning Approach to Online Lending Security

## Project Overview
This project represents my personal journey in developing an advanced fraud detection system for online lending platforms. As someone passionate about machine learning and financial security, I've created this system to leverage deep learning and natural language processing techniques to analyze user behavior patterns and identify potential fraudulent loan applications.

## My Development Process

### Phase 1: Data Understanding and Preprocessing
I began my journey by thoroughly analyzing the available data, which included:
- User behavior sequences (200,000 records from high-income users)
- Additional behavioral data (30,000 records from lower-income users)
- Various features including page view patterns, time spent on pages, and session information

### Phase 2: Feature Engineering and Model Development
In this phase, I implemented several innovative approaches:
1. **Word2Vec Embedding**: Developed a custom word2vec model to convert page view sequences into meaningful vector representations
2. **LSTM-based Models**: Created and tested various LSTM architectures to capture temporal patterns
3. **Custom Transformer Model**: Built a novel transformer architecture specifically designed for fraud detection

### Phase 3: Model Optimization and Results
Through careful experimentation and optimization, I achieved:
- AUC score of 0.59 on high-income dataset
- KS score of 0.1487
- Improved performance on lower-income dataset with AUC of 0.60

## Technical Implementation

### Data Processing Pipeline
My implementation includes:
1. Sequential feature extraction from user behavior
2. Custom word2vec embedding for page view sequences
3. Time-based feature engineering
4. Multi-head attention mechanism for pattern recognition

### Model Architecture
I developed a custom transformer model that:
- Processes sequential user behavior data
- Implements multi-head attention for pattern recognition
- Combines both sequential and non-sequential features
- Provides interpretable results through attention weights

## Future Improvements
I plan to enhance the system by:
1. Integration of additional behavioral features
2. Implementation of real-time processing capabilities
3. Development of an API for easy integration
4. Enhanced model interpretability features
