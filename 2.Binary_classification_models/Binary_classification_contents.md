# Binary Classification

After data exploration with some baseline models, we experimented with several combinations of deep learning architectures to see how these common-used methods perform.

## Contents
- Binary Classification Model1: **[Dense Layer, LSTM]**, Sequential features as imput for LSTM;
- Binary Classification Model2: **[Dense, CNN]**, Images (MTF & GAF along time series) as imput for CNN;
- Binary Classification Model3: **[Dense, CNN, LSTM]**, Sequential features as imput for LSTM, Images (MTF & GAF along time series) as imput for CNN;
- Binary Classification Model4: **[Dense, LSTM, CNN]**, Sequential features as imput for LSTM, Images (MTF along the features) as imput for CNN;
- Binary Classification Model5: **[Dense, LSTM, LSTM, CNN]**, Sequential features as imput for LSTM, Images (MTF along the features) as imput for CN;
- Binary Classification Model6: **[Dense, LSTM, CNN]**, Sequential features as imput for LSTM, Sequential features as imput for CNN;
- Binary Classification Model7: **[LSTM, CNN]**, Sequential features as imput for LSTM, Sequential features as imput for CNN;
